### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 is my favorite and at the top of the list because we learned how to use classes or rather learned to use classes. It was always very intersting how we used int, double, and float, and then use std::string but to be able to make my own was amazing and fun. Unfortunetly we didn't really make an class from ground up but only learned how to use the one that was already made it was still very interesting.

    * Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 is my secound favorite because it was really the first time we did something that gave such a hard time, I could'nt grasp it by myself for some parts and had to bug some of my partners in class. It took some revisiting of math that I havent used in sometime. Also it was the first time we used something much bigger than adding or subtracting in normal everyday applications. Using sin in the code was intersing.

    * Lab 8

    Lab 8, All of 8 was a favorite because we stopped making little codes and really got down to it the codes we where doing in the begging where extremly helpful especially because I really didnt know anything in the beggining of class and it took the help of a love one and bouncing ideas off of classmates to really get it done.Being able to write into a file and read from a files was amazing. It kinda warped my mined into thinking I could just spend a few hour after this class and just mess around with it more on free time and see what else I can do for fun with it.
